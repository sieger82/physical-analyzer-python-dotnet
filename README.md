# Extending Cellebrite Physical Analyzer with Python and .NET

This repo is a companion to my DEX-Online talk on November 9th, 2021. You can find the presentation slides in Presentation.pdf. All the code from the presentation can be found in the 6 python files and the hello_world .NET project.

### Use this code and examples at you own risk.

Also, the ccl_bplist and protobuf_decoder modules are not written/maintained by me. See the linked repos for the original creators.
